##### Here we have last minute revision notes of object oriented programming language. These questions will familiarize you with the most important object-oriented programming concepts and help you ace your job interviews ðŸ™Œ

### Most Asked OOPS Interview Questions ==>

## 1: What is OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING?
- Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm built on the concept of objects.
- In Other Words, it is an approach to problem-solving where all computations are carried out using objects.

## 2: Class and Object:
 Class: A class is the building block that leads to Object-Oriented programming. It is a user-defined datatype, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.

 Object: An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

## 3: Constructor:
- Constructors are special class members which are called by the compiler every time an object of that class is instantiated.
- Constructors have the same name as the class looks like method and does not have return type.
- If we provide return type to constructor it becomes a method.
#### There are 3 types of constructors:
    1. Default constructors
    2. Parameterized constructors
    3. Copy constructors
- Default Constructor: Default constructor is the constructor which doesnâ€™t take any argument. It has no parameters.
- Parameterized Constructor: A constructor is called Parameterized Constructor when it accepts a specific number of parameters.
- Copy Constructor: A copy constructor is a member function which initializes an object using another object of the same class.
### Characteristics of the constructor:
- Constructor has the same name as the class itself.
- Constructors donâ€™t have a return type.
- A constructor is automatically called when an object is created.
- It must be placed in the public section of class.
- If we do not specify a constructor, C++ compiler generates a default constructor for object (expects no parameters and has an empty body).
- Constructors can be overloaded.
- Constructor cannot be declared virtual.

## 4: Destructor:
- A destructor is also a special member function as a constructor. Destructor destroys the class objects created by the constructor.
- Destructor has the same name as their class name preceded by a tiled (~) symbol.
### Characteristics of the constructor:
- Destructor is invoked automatically by the compiler when its corresponding constructor goes out of scope and releases the memory space that is no longer required by the program.
- Destructor neither requires any argument nor returns any value therefore it cannot be overloaded.
- Destructor cannot be declared as static and const.
- Destructor should be declared in the public section of the program.
       
## 5: The main features of OOPs?

## 6: Inheritance :
Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming. The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.
